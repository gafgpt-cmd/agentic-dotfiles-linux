# dotfiles (Linux)

Linux port of [kunchenguid/dotfiles](https://github.com/kunchenguid/dotfiles), based on [GuillaumeTaffin/dotfiles-linux](https://github.com/GuillaumeTaffin/dotfiles-linux) and managed with standalone Home Manager.
One repo, one command, and a fresh Linux box ends up configured the same way every time.

Tested on Debian 13 with GNOME and Ubuntu 22.04/Linux Lite with XFCE. The distro-aware zsh installer supports apt, dnf, and pacman.

Nothing machine-specific is committed: username, home directory, and CPU architecture are read from the environment at switch time (hence `--impure` in the scripts). Clone it on any Linux box and run it as any user.

## What you get

Running the switch builds:

- Nix user packages (Git, GitHub CLI, ripgrep, fd, fzf, jq, lazygit, tmux, mise, uv, TypeScript, shellcheck, shfmt, Mosh, Neovim, WezTerm, Claude Code, Pi, herdr, Hack Nerd Font)
- Selectable GNOME/XFCE settings, a KDE compatibility profile, or no desktop settings
- Shell (zsh, aliases, starship prompt)
- Editor (a pinned 26-plugin Kickstart Neovim config with Tokyo Night)
- Terminal (WezTerm with rose-pine moon and clear inactive-window dimming)
- Selective Pi resources: theme, terminal-title extension, Calm mode, model overrides, and pinned packages
- Telemetry and error-reporting opt-outs across the managed agent and developer tools

The committed profile adopts only the shared WezTerm config; the baseline ownership is described below, and [Make it yours](#make-it-yours) lists the remaining opt-in switches.

## What Home Manager does here

[Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) is a reproducible installer and configuration manager for one user account. Nix is the underlying package and build engine; Home Manager adds the user-environment layer that turns this repository into an activatable setup.

A Nix flake is the project interface that Nix reads. It consists of `flake.nix`, which declares the external inputs and the configurations or other outputs the project provides, and `flake.lock`, which records the exact revision of every input. The part after `#` in a flake reference selects an output; here, `#default` selects this repository's default Home Manager configuration. `--impure` broadly permits access to mutable paths and repositories; this flake currently uses that permission only to read `USER`, `HOME`, and `builtins.currentSystem` for the current machine. External inputs remain locked by `flake.lock`.

```text
flake.nix + flake.lock + home.nix + profile.nix
                       |
                       v
                 Home Manager
                       |
                       +-- installs locked user programs
                       +-- sets environment variables and PATH
                       +-- manages explicitly enabled config files
                       +-- creates and activates a generation
```

In this repository:

- `flake.nix` declares the nixpkgs, Home Manager, nixGL, separate nixpkgs snapshot for Pi, and herdr inputs and exposes the configurations Home Manager can build; `flake.lock` locks those inputs to exact revisions.
- `home.nix` declares the programs, font, privacy controls, PATH entries, and optional config-file links that should exist for the current user.
- `profile.nix` decides which existing shell, editor, terminal, agent, and desktop settings Home Manager is allowed to adopt.
- `home-manager switch` evaluates those declarations, downloads or builds the required packages in the Nix store, creates a new generation, and activates it for the current user.
- `./rebuild.sh` repeats that switch after a package or declarative setting changes.

Each switch creates a generation: a versioned snapshot of the store-managed packages and links that Home Manager activated. Older generations can restore that managed state. Adopted configurations use links to the live files in this repository, however, so a Home Manager rollback does not restore earlier contents of those files; use Git to roll their contents back.

With the checked-in baseline profile (`desktop = "none"`, `manageWezterm = true`, and every other `manage...` switch false), Home Manager:

- Installs every package declared in `home.packages`, enables the Home Manager CLI, and installs Hack Nerd Font with user-level fontconfig integration.
- Generates the user-environment setup that adds the Nix profiles to `PATH` and exports the telemetry opt-outs plus `AGENTIC_DISPLAY_SERVER=auto` to shell and systemd user sessions.
- Runs the Codex privacy activation that preserves unrelated settings while enforcing the analytics and OpenTelemetry keys documented under [Telemetry policy](#telemetry-policy).
- Adopts `~/.config/wezterm` from this repository. Existing shell, editor, agent, and desktop configuration remains untouched; [Make it yours](#make-it-yours) lists every switch and its scope.

This is not a replacement for the Linux distribution. It does not manage the kernel, drivers, display manager, system-wide packages, or root services. Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, or Arch still own the operating system; Home Manager owns only the selected user environment.

## Prerequisites

- Linux (x86_64 or ARM; the architecture is detected at switch time).

## Fresh-machine setup

From a bare clone:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gafgpt-cmd/agentic-dotfiles-linux.git
cd agentic-dotfiles-linux
```

Before you run it: review "Make it yours" below.

```sh
./bootstrap.sh
```

`bootstrap.sh` does five things, in order.
It is idempotent: re-running it on a configured machine is a no-op that ends in a green step 5.

1. Installs Determinate Nix, if it isn't already installed.
2. Symlinks this repo to `~/.dotfiles`.
   This has to happen before the first build, because `home.nix` points at config files through `~/.dotfiles`.
   If that path already exists and points elsewhere, bootstrap stops instead of replacing it.
3. Runs the first `home-manager switch`.
   It fetches the `home-manager` tool from the release-26.05 branch, then applies this repo's locked flake config for your user (read from the environment, nothing to edit).
   No sudo: standalone home-manager only writes inside your home directory.
4. If `manageShell` is enabled, installs zsh from the distro package manager and makes it your login shell.
   Deliberately the distro's zsh and not Nix's: `/usr/bin/zsh` always exists, so a broken home-manager generation can never lock you out of an SSH login.
   With the safe default, the existing login shell, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.zshenv`, and starship config remain untouched.
5. Verifies installed binaries plus every enabled Home Manager file, including baseline environment/font files and profile-adopted config, and exits non-zero listing whatever failed.
   Any earlier step that dies also prints a `BOOTSTRAP FAILED` banner, so a partial setup can't be mistaken for a finished one.

It asks for sudo only if Nix or the optional distro zsh package must be installed.

After that, `home-manager` exists and you're on the normal workflow below.

### Validate without applying

```sh
nix --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' flake check --no-build --impure
nix --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' build .#homeConfigurations.default.activationPackage --dry-run --impure
./tests/linux-config.test.sh
./tests/profile-matrix.test.sh
./tests/wezterm-raw-helper.test.sh
./tests/pi-calm.test.sh
./tests/build-matrix.sh
# Static Neovim ownership/lock checks
bash tests/nvim-config.test.sh
# Isolated Neovim runtime test; downloads the pinned plugins and Mason tools
bash tests/nvim-runtime.test.sh
```

`--impure` is required: the flake reads `$USER`, `$HOME`, and the CPU architecture from the environment.

## Daily use

Edit the config files in place, then apply:

```sh
./rebuild.sh
```

### Connecting with Mosh

The switch installs `mosh-server`, so from any machine with a mosh client:

```sh
mosh <host>
```

Two things must hold:

- If `manageShell` is enabled, bootstrap sets zsh as the login shell and Home Manager puts `~/.nix-profile/bin` on its non-interactive PATH.
- You must allow Mosh's UDP ports through your firewall. The default range is 60000-61000; a smaller explicit range works with `mosh -p 60000:60010 <host>`.

If the client reports `mosh-server: command not found`, bypass PATH: `mosh --server='.nix-profile/bin/mosh-server' <host>`.

## Make it yours

Username, home directory, and CPU architecture need no editing: they come from the environment at switch time.

The checked-in `profile.nix` owns the shared WezTerm config and leaves every other established config untouched: `desktop = "none"`, `manageWezterm = true`, and every other adoption switch false. Review that WezTerm config before the first switch, then enable only the additional parts you want Home Manager to own:

- `desktop`: `xfce`, `gnome`, `kde`, or `none`.
- `displayServer`: `x11`, `wayland`, or `auto`. Explicit values select WezTerm's native backend; `auto` leaves toolkit detection alone.
- `manageShell`: zsh files, aliases, editor variable, starship config, and login-shell setup.
- `manageWezterm`: the shared terminal config; enabled in the checked-in profile.
- `manageNvim`, `manageHerdr`: the matching config directory; disabled by default.
- `managePiResources`: Pi settings, model overrides, themes, and extensions; never credentials, sessions, caches, or runtime state.
- `manageClaudeSettings`: off by default so an established Claude setup is not replaced.
- `manageAgentInstructions`: off by default so Kun's policy does not silently replace your own Claude, Codex, or OpenCode instructions.

**Git identity:** this config deliberately does not set your git name or email.
Git will stop your first commit and tell you to set them (`git config --global user.name "Your Name"` and `git config --global user.email you@example.com`).
If you'd rather manage that declaratively, add this to `home.nix` with your own identity:

```nix
programs.git = {
  enable = true;
  settings.user = {
    name = "Your Name";
    email = "you@example.com";
  };
};
```

The `cc` and `co` aliases launch Claude and Codex with their normal configured permission behavior. This fork does not force bypass or full-auto modes.

The checked-in Neovim tree is the feature-rich pinned Kickstart configuration, including its Lazy lock, LSP/Mason setup, Treesitter, completion, formatting, and authored helper modules. `manageNvim` is still off in the safe profile, so an established machine keeps its existing `~/.config/nvim` until you explicitly opt in.

## Repo tour

The files in the configuration-to-activation flow are explained under [What Home Manager does here](#what-home-manager-does-here).

- `gnome.nix` / `xfce.nix` / `kde.nix` - optional Linux desktop compatibility modules.
- `home/` - edit-in-place app and agent resources.
- `tests/` - Linux wiring, full desktop/session matrix, Pi Calm behavior, and isolated Neovim runtime tests.

## How the symlinks work

For a config family enabled in `profile.nix`, the files under `home/` become the live files; editing them needs no rebuild.
`home.nix` uses `mkOutOfStoreSymlink` to point adopted paths like `~/.config/nvim` straight at this repo, so the two never drift out of sync. Disabled families are not touched.
You only run `./rebuild.sh` when you change something that isn't just a symlinked file, like a package list or a dconf setting.

Pi is handled more narrowly: Home Manager links authored themes, extensions, `models.json`, and `settings.json`, never `~/.pi/agent` as a whole. Credentials, sessions, caches, downloaded packages, and Calm's local toggle remain outside Git.

The Pi settings pin `pi-web-access`, Codex fast mode, and OpenAI server-side compaction. These packages execute with your user permissions; review their immutable versions in `home/.pi/agent/settings.json` before switching. The compaction package sends relevant conversation state to OpenAI.
Pi itself is pinned through a separate nixpkgs snapshot because the 26.05 stable snapshot still carries Pi 0.75; the Calm extension's real terminal test targets the pinned Pi 0.84.

## Desktop and display-server support

The flake exposes and builds six profiles: GNOME, XFCE, and KDE Plasma on both X11 and Wayland. Desktop modules only configure user preferences; the distro remains responsible for installing the desktop, display manager, GPU stack, and session itself.

| Profile | Settings backend | X11 | Wayland |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GNOME | Home Manager dconf | Build-tested | Build-tested |
| XFCE | Home Manager xfconf; generic GTK files preserved | Build-tested | Build-tested portable subset; [XFCE's Wayland session remains preliminary](https://wiki.xfce.org/releng/wayland_roadmap) |
| KDE Plasma | No KConfig ownership; existing settings preserved | Build-tested | Build-tested |

`displayServer = "x11"` makes an adopted WezTerm config use X11. `displayServer = "wayland"` enables its [native Wayland backend](https://wezterm.org/config/lua/config/enable_wayland.html). `auto` keeps WezTerm's own detection. GNOME preferences are shared by both session types. KDE compatibility leaves every KConfig preference untouched. XFCE leaves generic GTK files untouched; its Wayland profile also omits X11-only XSettings and xfwm4 keys while retaining Thunar and xfdesktop preferences.

## Telemetry policy

Telemetry is off across the managed stack. Home Manager exports the supported Claude Code, Pi, OpenTelemetry, GNHF, no-mistakes, Lavish AXI, Homebrew, JavaScript framework, .NET, PowerShell, HashiCorp, Scarf, Hugging Face, and DVC opt-out variables. Pi's settings also explicitly disable its install ping and opt-in analytics; its separate version check is disabled too.

Codex needs an additional config change because its analytics setting defaults to enabled independently of generic OpenTelemetry variables. Each switch atomically preserves the rest of `~/.codex/config.toml` while enforcing:

```toml
[analytics]
enabled = false

[otel]
exporter = "none"
trace_exporter = "none"
metrics_exporter = "none"
log_user_prompt = false
```

The bundled local extensions and pinned Pi packages were checked for additional remote analytics hooks. Functional network traffic remains: model/API calls, web access, GitHub access, package downloads, and the explicitly documented server-side compaction request are not telemetry.

## What changed from the macOS original

| macOS | Linux |
| --- | --- |
| nix-darwin `darwinConfigurations` | standalone home-manager `homeConfigurations` |
| `configuration.nix` system defaults | selected `gnome.nix`, `xfce.nix`, `kde.nix`, or none |
| Homebrew casks (`wezterm`, `claude-code`) | nixpkgs packages in `home.nix` |
| `herdr` Homebrew formula | the upstream herdr flake, pinned in `flake.nix` |
| `darwin-rebuild switch` (sudo) | `home-manager switch` (no sudo) |
| `/Users/$user` | `/home/$user` |

Dropped with no portable Linux equivalent: menu-bar behavior, hardware-specific touchpad settings, and WezTerm's `macos_window_background_blur`. Window blur remains the compositor's job.
